# Poll

For the last assignment I had the opportunity to choose between a few cases. I chose for creating a poll. It is kind of a cool concept that people can create a poll and others can answer them. I need to work with saving data to a specific file which I have never done before, so it seems like a fun experiment! In this readme you will find my most important insights and explanations about specific parts of my work.

# Poll

For the last assignment I had the opportunity to choose between a few cases. I chose for creating a poll. It is kind of a cool concept that people can create a poll and others can answer them. I need to work with saving data to a specific file which I have never done before, so it seems like a fun experiment! In this readme you will find my most important insights and explanations about specific parts of my work.

*Only available on friday april 7th 2022*

## User Story
> I want to be able to present a poll to students with questions and answers during a lecture, and show the results immediately.

## Wireflow

## Core Functionality
In the wireflow above you can see the most important functionalities of the website. 
**There are three functions that fulfill the purpose of a poll:**
- Creating a poll
- Answering a poll
- See the results of a poll

It doesn't matter if javascript or css is disabled. These functions should always work on the website no matter what. If these functions work you got yourself a beautiful poll website right? Well... yes, but wouldn't it be way more beautiful if the website looks cooler and has some cool extra features? Of course it would, so keep on reading!
